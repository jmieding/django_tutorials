    <img src="{% static 'blog_pics/headshot_bw_circle.gif' %}" />
    My 9-5 is spent reviewing and negotiating contracts for oil and gas companies, so I think it's fair to say I'm not a typical software developer. I started dabbling with software in May 2015, and I was quickly blown away by how much could be accomplished with a terminal window and some basic syntax. I've been learning on my own ever since, mostly focusing on Python, Django, Javascript, and of course HTML/CSS technologies. You're looking at my first dynamic (MVC) website built from scratch.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here's what I'm doing outside of my 9-5 that gets me excited:</p>
    <p><b>What I'm currently reading:</b> Effective Python, Blood Meridian, The Practice of Practice</p>
    <p><b>What I'm listening to:</b> Code Winds(Podcast), Talk Python to Me(Podcast)</p>
    <p><b>What I'm building:</b> Web app that displays local weather, Javascript Calculator</p>
